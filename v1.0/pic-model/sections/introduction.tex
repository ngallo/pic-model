This model is derived from a natural observation of the delegation pattern and multhop nature dei sistemi distributii. Even in a paper-based artifact format, delegation involves the delegator (who signs) and the delegate (who proves their identity). In such a model, an artifact loses its meaning if the delegate is removed; anyone who acquires it can claim its use, thereby nullifying the intrinsic value of the delegation artifact itself. The two minimal required entities are the delegator and the delegate. Therefore, the validity of both the delegator and the delegate must be proven—two single inputs. Any other method that introduces complexity only increases the attack surface, rendering the approach weaker from a security perspective.
