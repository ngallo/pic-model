The \textbf{Executor-First Paradigm} mandates that identity is an emergent property of the current execution state and its verifiable cause. 
The Provenance Identity Continuity (PIC) Model defines the invariants that identity \textbf{MUST} satisfy across the entire causal sequence of execution, addressing the inherent limitations of artifact-centric security models.

The model includes the \textbf{Structural Impossibility Claim (NO-GO Result)}, which presents a structural impossibility argument, not a mathematical proof. Formal treatment is delegated to future work.
